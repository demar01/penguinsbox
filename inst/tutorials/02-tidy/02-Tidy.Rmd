## Introduction

```{r protein-structure, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap="Image by Allison Horst"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/man/figures/lter_penguins.png")
```

### Learning goals

The goal of this tutorial is to show how to recognize messy data and tidy data using tidyr's `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` functions.


## Tidy data

There are three interrelated rules that make a dataset ordered:

- Each variable must have its own column.
- Each observation must have its own row.
- Each value must have its own cell.

```{r tidy-data, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap="Figure 12.1: The three rules of a tidy dataset: variables are in columns, observations are in rows, and values are in cells."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/blob/master/images/tidy-1.png?raw=true")
```

Remember that working with tidy data principles will make your data science analysis more effective and consistent with R tools for data science.

###

Imagine that we have this `new_penguins` dataset:
```{r echo = TRUE}
new_penguins
```

### Test 1 - Recognize the variables

```{r test1, echo = FALSE}
question("What are the variables in the data set above? Check all that apply.",
         answer("year", correct = TRUE),
         answer("bill_depth_mm", correct = TRUE),
         answer("bill_length_mm", correct = TRUE),
         answer("int"),
         answer("dbl"),
         allow_retry = TRUE,
         correct = "Very well! new_penguins contains four observations measured with three variables: year,bill_depth_mm, bill_length_mm"
)
```
### Test 2 - Recognize tidy data

Consider this other penguins dataset called `more_penguins`:

```{r echo = TRUE}
more_penguins
```

```{r test2, echo = FALSE}
question("Is this tibble ordered?",
         answer("No", correct = TRUE, message = "If you look carefully there are different variables in the same column (i.e. column measurement)."),
         answer("Yes", message = "Don't be fooled because the numerical values are in a column (`observations`)  and the variables are in another column (`measurement`). Look at  `measurement` column, does it have more than one variable?"),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

## Pivot wider

Messy data is quite common in datasets. An example of messy data is when an observation appears in multiple rows, like in the example below:

```{r echo = TRUE}
new_penguins2
```
Each year has an observation, but the morphological information is __hidden__ in the column called `morphology` , so that each morphological observation appears in two rows. To get tidy data from this tibble we'd have to increase the number of columns and decrease the number of rows, generating a wider table using `pivot_wider()`.


```{r}
new_penguins2 %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = morphology, values_from = value)
```

## Pivot longer

On the other hand, a variable can be spread over several columns like in the example below.
```{r}
new_penguins3
```

In this case we have to narrow the table by making it longer. To do this we can use `pivot_longer()`; remember that when using `pivot_longer()` is up to us to decide the name of the new columns.  In the next exercise replace the ___ with the names of the new column being `year` and `body_mass_g`.

```{r expl, exercise = TRUE}
new_penguins3%>%
  pivot_longer(`2019`:`2020`, names_to = "___", values_to = "___")
```

```{r expl-hint-1}
new_penguins3%>%
  pivot_longer(`2019`:`2020`, names_to = "year", values_to = "___")
```


```{r expl-solution,eval=FALSE}
new_penguins3%>%
  pivot_longer(`2019`:`2020`, names_to = "year", values_to = "body_mass_g")
```

## Exercise - Reconstruct the data 

We can use `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider` consecutively to untidy data and then get a final tidy data. For example starting with `new_penguins`:
```{r echo = TRUE}
new_penguins
```

###

We can flatten the data with `pivot_wider()`:
```{r}
new_penguins%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = bill_length_mm)
```

And return to an ordered format with `pivot_longer()`:
```{r echo = TRUE}
new_penguins %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = bill_length_mm) %>%
  pivot_longer(`2019`:`2020`, names_to = "year", values_to = "bill_length_mm",
               names_transform = list(year = as.numeric))
```

## Wrap up

Working with ordered data in R allows you to fully utilize R's vector functions (e.g. `mutate()`, `separate()` and many more functions). You can sort the data at the beginning of your analysis to facilitate downstream actions. Your data is ordered if:

- Each variable has its own column.
- Each observation has its own row.
- Each value has its own cell.

You can use `pivot_wider` and `pivot_longer` or some iterative sequence of the two, to reshape your data so that:

- All values from your original dataset are preserved.
- All relationships between values are retained in your original data set.
